# Product Requirements Document: Grocery List Modification

## Introduction/Overview

The Grocery Voice Assistant currently allows users to add items to their grocery list through voice commands. However, users cannot modify or remove items once they're on the list. This feature enhancement will enable users to modify existing items (change quantities) or remove items entirely through natural voice commands, making the application more flexible and user-friendly.

## Goals

1. Enable users to remove specific items from their grocery list through voice commands
2. Allow users to modify the quantity of existing items through voice commands
3. Process these modification commands in natural language across all supported languages
4. Maintain a simple, intuitive user experience with immediate feedback

## User Stories

1. **As a user**, I want to remove an item from my grocery list by saying something like "remove milk from the list" so that I can update my list when I no longer need an item.

2. **As a user**, I want to change the quantity of an item by saying something like "change apples to 5" so that I can adjust my shopping list without starting over.

3. **As a user**, I want to speak naturally when modifying my list, rather than using specific command syntax, so that the interaction feels conversational and intuitive.

4. **As a user**, I want immediate updates to my list when I make modifications so that I can see the current state of my grocery list at all times.

## Functional Requirements

1. The system must detect and parse voice commands that indicate list modifications (removal or quantity changes).

2. The system must be able to identify items in the current grocery list that match or closely match the items mentioned in modification commands.

3. The system must support item removal commands in natural language, including both direct commands and conversational statements (e.g., "remove milk", "take off the cheese", "I don't need eggs anymore", "well, I think we don't need apples").

4. The system must support quantity modification commands in natural language (e.g., "change apples to 3", "make it 2 bottles of water", "I need 5 bananas instead").

5. The system must update the grocery list UI immediately after processing modification commands.

6. The system must handle ambiguous requests by making a best guess at the user's intention without requesting confirmation.

7. The system must support these modification commands in all languages the application supports, not limited to English and Russian.

8. The system must log errors when users attempt to modify items that don't exist in the current list, without disrupting the UI.

9. The system must maintain the current grocery list only for the duration of the browser session.

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. Persistence of grocery lists between browser sessions
2. Confirmation flows for list modifications
3. Handling of complex conditional modifications (e.g., "remove apples if oranges are on the list")
4. User authentication or personal list management
5. Undo/redo functionality for modifications
6. Support for partial item modifications (e.g., changing just the item name but keeping the quantity)

## Design Considerations

- The current UI displaying the grocery list should remain largely unchanged, with items simply appearing, disappearing, or updating as modifications are made.
- No additional UI elements are needed for this feature as it relies entirely on voice input.
- Consider adding subtle animations when items are removed or modified to provide visual feedback to the user.

## Technical Considerations

1. Extend the existing voice processing pipeline to identify modification intents (remove, change quantity), including conversational statements that imply modifications.
2. Enhance the language model prompt to handle these modification commands and return structured data that indicates:
   - What action to take (add, remove, modify)
   - Which item is affected
   - The new quantity (for modifications)
3. Update the grocery item state management to handle removal and modification operations.
4. Implement fuzzy matching to handle cases where the spoken item name doesn't exactly match the list item.
5. Consider batching multiple modifications from a single voice command (e.g., "remove milk and change apples to 3").
6. Treat items with different qualifiers (e.g., "apples", "red apples", "green apples") as distinct items.
7. Update the evaluation framework to test new modification scenarios while ensuring backward compatibility with existing addition scenarios.

## Success Metrics

1. Users can successfully remove items from their list through voice commands at least 90% of the time.
2. Users can successfully modify item quantities through voice commands at least 85% of the time.
3. The system correctly interprets modification intents in at least 90% of test cases across supported languages.
4. No increase in application error rates or performance degradation with the addition of this feature.

## Evaluation Requirements

1. The evaluation framework must be extended to test the new modification functionality.
2. New test cases should be created specifically for:
   - Item removal through direct commands
   - Item removal through conversational statements
   - Quantity modifications through various phrasings
   - Handling of multiple modifications in a single command
3. Existing test cases for item addition must continue to pass without modification.
4. The evaluation output should clearly distinguish between addition and modification test cases.
5. Success metrics should be tracked separately for addition vs. modification operations.
