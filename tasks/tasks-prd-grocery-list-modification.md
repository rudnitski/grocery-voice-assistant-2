## Relevant Files

- `components/grocery-list.tsx` - Main component that displays the grocery list and needs updating to handle item removal and modifications.
- `lib/services/grocery-service.ts` - Service that processes grocery voice transcripts; needs to be enhanced to handle modification intents.
- `lib/prompts/grocery-prompts.ts` - Contains prompts for the language model; needs updating to support modification commands.
- `lib/hooks/use-grocery-list.ts` - Custom hook for managing grocery list state; needs to support removing and modifying items.
- `evals/scripts/run-grocery-eval.ts` - Evaluation script that needs updating to test modification scenarios.
- `evals/utils/eval-criteria.ts` - Defines evaluation criteria; needs updating to support modification criteria.
- `evals/data/grocery_test_data.jsonl` - Test data file that needs new test cases for modification scenarios.

### Notes

- We need to ensure backward compatibility while adding new functionality.
- The evaluation framework needs to distinguish between addition and modification test cases.
- The feature should work with conversational language patterns in all supported languages.
